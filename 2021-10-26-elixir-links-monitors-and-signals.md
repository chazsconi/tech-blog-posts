# Spawning processes without a supervision tree

# Single GenServer without Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)

## GenServer stopped with GenServer.stop

Supervisors do not need to be explicitly stopped

GenServers will also exit if the parent terminates with :normal if trapping exits:

# tl;dr

Try to have processes under a supervision tree when designing and Elixir application, otherwise you will
need to write more code and be open to mistakes.

# Recap

1. :normal exit signals are ignored by the receiving process if not trapping exits.  If trapping exits they are received as messages.

unless trapping exits, in which case, these will be received as messages. If itâ€™s sent by self, and not trapping exits, it will cause the process to terminate with a :normal exit reason, but will log an error.

2. :kill exit signals always result in the termination of the receiving process.

3. Exit signals with other reasons will terminate the receiving process unless trapping exits, in which case, these will be received as messages.
